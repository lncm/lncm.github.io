We claimed victory with the creation of a technical demo for a system called \"Supercavitation Swaps\".</p>\n<p>Supercaviation Swaps uses the Lightning Network to allow BTC to be swapped for RSK's RBTC, quickly, cheaply, and in a trust-minimized way.  Swaps are settled in under a minute, have low fees, and are completed without having to trust a centralized exchange or federation.</p>\n<p>Our approach allows any user with a Lighting Network wallet to easily onboard onto RSK, and even those who don't already own any RBTC can do so safely in a novel, trust-minimised way.</p>\n<p>During the 24 hour hackathon, we deployed a working demo to the RSK testnet, using testnet Lightning BTC and a frontend on IPFS. </p>\n<p>We built upon the ideas of <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/submarine-swaps/\">Lightning to BTC Atomic Swaps (\"Submarine Swaps\")</a> by Alex Bosworth and <a href=\"https://blog.goodaudience.com/atomic-on-chain-eth-to-off-chain-btc-swap-3c959ab22e52\">Lightning to ETH Atomic Swaps</a> by Jason Wong.</p>\n<p>For more a more detailed overview on the rationale and to view the code, please have a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/lncm/supercavitation-swaps\">github repository</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Supercavitation Swaps","date":"2019.01.15"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/project/supercavitation-swaps/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
