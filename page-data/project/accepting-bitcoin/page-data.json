But they mostly fall into four general categories, starting with\nthe most rudimentary and ending with the most sophisticated:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Deposit addresses at exchanges (please don't do this!)</li>\n<li>Smartphone and desktop apps</li>\n<li>Commercial payment processors</li>\n<li>Self-hosted full-node-based solutions</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The fact is, accepting Bitcoin payments is fundamentally easy. For most of\nBitcoin's existence, people often just posted a \"Bitcoin address\" on their\nwebsite and used it like a bank account. While this approach has numerous and\nvery significant disadvantages (among other things, it means everyone can see\nhow much money you are taking in) it nevertheless still works.</p>\n<p>The slightly more sophisticated variation on this idea is to sign up for an\naccount at a major cryptocurrency exchange (like\n<a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en\">Binance</a> or\n<a href=\"https://www.bitstamp.com/\">Bitstamp</a>), go to the account page, and generate a\n\"deposit address\". Some exchanges (such as Bitstamp) will even auto-convert\nincoming payments to fiat currency, if you tell them to.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, while this approach is very quick and easy to set up, it\ncomes with major drawbacks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The whole world can see your incoming payments</li>\n<li>You have to manually check the address (probably using a blockchain explorer\nwebsite like <a href=\"https://blockstream.info/\">Blockstream.info</a> or\n<a href=\"https://mempool.space/\">Mempool.space</a>) to see if a payment comes in</li>\n<li>The address is permanently associated with \"you\", so anyone looking at your\nclients' transactions will see they did business with you, how often, and how\nmuch money they spent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if this very rudimentary approach does the trick for the moment, sooner or\nlater you <em>will</em> outgrow it and need something more sophisticated. Therefore,\nlet's look at the \"real\" options.</p>\n<h4 id=\"apps-to-accept-bitcoin-probably-the-simplest-way-that-works\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#apps-to-accept-bitcoin-probably-the-simplest-way-that-works\" aria-label=\"apps to accept bitcoin probably the simplest way that works permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Apps To Accept Bitcoin: Probably The Simplest Way That Works</h4>\n<p>Installing an app on your phone is easy.

We mentioned \"lightning channels\" a couple of times. If\nyou're going to accept Lightning (instantaneous) Bitcoin payments, you should\nprobably understand what they are and why \"managing\" them is so important.</p>\n<p>None of this matters if you only accept \"on-chain\" (normal) Bitcoin payments.\nOn-chain payments are very simple. Unfortunately, they also take time (at least\n10 minutes, on average) and the fees your customers have to pay may be\nsubstantial. If your customers can make Lightning payments to you, the payment\nbecomes more or less instantaneous, and fees are effectively zero.</p>\n<p>If your transactions are small and frequent (like a coffee shop or an\ninexpensive web hosting service) then being able to pay with Lightning is\nhugely beneficial. On the other hand, if your customers are primarily making\nvery large transactions, the simplicity and very high security level of\non-chain (non-Lightning) payments will tend to be more important.</p>\n<p>Since most small businesses will want at least the option to accept Lightning\npayments, it's helpful to understand some basics about the technology.</p>\n<p>The Lightning Network is based on relationships between parties, called\n\"channels.\" Each \"Lightning channel\" is an agreement between you and some 3rd\nparty (who you either have to trust a little bit, or don't have to trust at\nall, depending on how you set things up). The agreement allows you to receive\n(or send) payments through them to other members of the Lightning Network to\nwhom that 3rd party is connected.</p>\n<p>If all you're going to do is <em>send</em> money, setting up one of these agreements\nis easy: you \"lock\" (escrow) your money up to pre-fund the channel, and once\nyou've sent all the money to various people, your Lightning channel\ncounterparty gets to keep all the money (with your agreement, of course). It's\na pretty good deal for the other side!</p>\n<p>(And yes, you can \"close\" the channel any time you want, with the balance being\ndivided up appropriately between both of you. They can also close it, if they\nwant.)</p>\n<p>However, if you are mostly <em>receiving</em> money, then it is your counterparty who\nhas to commit their money to the channel. This ties up their capital for some\nperiod of time, and it makes things a little complex.</p>\n<p>(Why would they commit their capital to help you receive money? Either because\nthey are earning fees on your transactions -- generally <em>much smaller fees</em>\nthan what you would pay for credit card processors -- or because you are\noutright paying them to do it.)</p>\n<p>Therefore, if you're just starting out and want to accept Lightning payments,\nchoosing a wallet that will manage these issues for you (generally at slightly\nhigher cost) is a good idea.</p>\n<h4 id=\"commercial-payment-processors-how-most-ecommerce-shops-do-it\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#commercial-payment-processors-how-most-ecommerce-shops-do-it\" aria-label=\"commercial payment processors how most ecommerce shops do it permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Commercial Payment Processors: How Most eCommerce Shops Do It</h4>\n<p>So far we've talked about local apps that you can run on your mobile device.\nThat, as convenient as it may be, simply isn't an option for e-commerce\nbusinesses, where the payments have to be processed automatically.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are plenty of Bitcoin payment processors who are happy to\nprovide the same service that a credit-card payment processor would, except in\nthis case, they are handling Bitcoin payments.</p>\n<p>Here are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://coingate.com/\">Coingate</a>: allows you to accept both Lightning and\non-chain payments seamlessly.

Like any other payment processor, they will deposit local currency to your\nbank account according to the Bitcoin which you receive. Alternately, most of\nthem will let you keep the Bitcoin as Bitcoin, and \"cash out\" to your personal\nwallet.</p>\n<p>For mobile apps and self-hosted solutions, you have to convert to local\ncurrency separately.  You generally do this via an exchange, either a\ncentralized one or a decentralized one.</p>\n<p>Centralized exchanges are easy to use but have bureaucratic overhead (you have\nto get verified, there may be limits, and they can close your account if they\ndecide they don't like you). Examples of centralized exchanges include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en\">Binance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bitstamp.com/\">Bitstamp</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Decentralized exchanges are a bit harder to get started with, but there is no\nverification, no bureaucracy, and it's very difficult for anyone to stop you\nfrom using them. For exammple, we've already mentioned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bisq.network/\">Bisq</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hodlhodl.com/\">HodlHodl</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now one big question is... when should you go and sell the Bitcoin that you\nreceive?</p>\n<p>If your profit margins are thin, you may not have any choice in the matter. You\nneed the money to pay for goods and pay your employees!</p>\n<p>However, if you are providing digital downloads or another very high-margin\nproduct, you can turn accepting Bitcoin through your business into something\nreally neat: a way to accumulate Bitcoin for investment at no cost to you!</p>\n<p>Here's how it works:</p>\n<p>You will probably notice that a lot of the customers paying Bitcoin in your\nbusiness are customers who would normally not have purchased from you at all.\nThese are extra sales, supplemental to the ones you usually make.</p>\n<p>If your cost-per-sale is zero, or close to zero, then once you've covered your\noverhead then each additional sale is free money.</p>\n<p>Since these sales are bringing in Bitcoin, you can simply keep the Bitcoin they\nsend you and hold (\"hodl\") it in the long term. If the price goes up\ndramatically, fantastic -- you're rich! If the price goes down, it's no big\ndeal... that was \"free money,\" which you wouldn't have normally made anyway.</p>\n<h4 id=\"no-theyre-not-stuck-how-to-move-your-lightning-bitcoins-to-a-regular-wallet\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#no-theyre-not-stuck-how-to-move-your-lightning-bitcoins-to-a-regular-wallet\" aria-label=\"no theyre not stuck how to move your lightning bitcoins to a regular wallet permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>No, They're Not Stuck: How To Move Your \"Lightning\" Bitcoins To A Regular Wallet</h4>\n<p>If you set things up the way most people do, you will probably be accepting a\nlot of payments via the Bitcoin Lightning Network.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the wallet or payment provider you're using may make it\nless-than-obvious how you can move that money from the Lightning Network to a\nregular Bitcoin wallet address.</p>\n<p>At the same time, if you are using a hardware wallet like a Trezor or Ledger to\nsecure most of your funds (you should be doing this!), you need to send those\nBitcoins to a \"normal\" Bitcoin address... outside the Lightning Network.</p>\n<p>The answer is pretty easy. First, if you have a mobile device which your staff\nare using to accept funds, you'll want to move funds off that device on a\nregular basis, to a device which is more secure.</p>\n<p>Since you'll need a second device anyway, install Muun Wallet on that device,\nor another Bitcoin wallet which makes moving from Lighting to regular Bitcoin\naddresses very easy.</p>\n<p>Then use your \"back-office device\" to move funds around.
